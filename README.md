# Playing Cards Distribution – Tyrell Systems Technical Assessment

This repository contains my solution for the **Tyrell Systems Programming Test (Playing Cards)**.  
The task is to distribute a standard 52-card deck to **N people**, following strict rules for validation, output format, and error handling.

I used the following languages as requested by the assessment:
- **PHP** (backend processing)
- **JavaScript**
- **jQuery**  
These cover both backend and frontend requirements.

All code is written in **UTF-8** encoding, and line breaks follow **LF (Unix)** format, as required.
